# Finance
A site to "buy" and "sell" stocks, built with Flask and SQLite for user data.

Users can create an account, look up stock prices, and buy/sell stocks.   They can see the current portfolio of their stocks and also the history of their transactions.

## Requirements
The site uses IEXâ€™s API to fetch stock data and thus you need an API key from https://iexcloud.io/
## Running
`export API_KEY=<your key here>`  
`flask run`
